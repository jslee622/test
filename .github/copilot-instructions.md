# Copilot Instructions

## Repository Overview

This is a test repository currently in early stages with minimal codebase. As the project evolves, these instructions will be updated to reflect the actual architecture and conventions.

## Current State

- **Primary Files**: README.md
- **Project Type**: Early-stage (awaiting implementation)
- **Repository Root**: `test/`

## Development Approach for Future Growth

When implementing code in this repository:

### Code Organization
- Follow simple, flat structure initially
- Move to organized subdirectories (src/, lib/, tests/) as the project grows
- Keep related functionality together

### Documentation
- Update README.md with project goals and setup instructions
- Document architectural decisions as they're made
- Include code examples for complex patterns

### Version Control
- Use the existing Git repository (main branch)
- Write clear commit messages describing the "why" behind changes
- Reference issues or tasks in commit messages when applicable

## Integration Points
*To be documented once external dependencies are introduced*

## Testing & Builds
*To be documented once test framework and build scripts are established*

**Last Updated**: February 2026

*Note: This file will be updated as the codebase evolves. Adjust conventions based on actual implementation patterns.*
